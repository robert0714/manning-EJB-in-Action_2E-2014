All of the chapters are Maven based and can be easily opened in NetBeans, IntelliJ, or Eclipse. The code samples were tested on GlassFish 3 (non Java EE 7 code) and GlassFish 4 for Java EE 7 (EJB 3.2) specific features. 

To build run "mvn package" in the chapter sub-directory that you want to build.
